Terraform is the set of files which describe how to define a Infrastructure with IAC.

Let me explain very firt that is about varialbes files.


you can take any file name to define variables but variables.tf is suggested.

Let me talk first about input variables.

Which are useful to interact with terraform code.(Like other languages)

ex: vi variables.tf

#https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html

variable "access_key" {}
variable "secret_key" {}
variable "region" {
  default = "us-east-1"
}

This defines three variables within your Terraform configuration. The first two have empty blocks {}. 
The third sets a default. If a default value is set, the variable is optional. Otherwise, the variable is required. 
If you run terraform plan now, Terraform will prompt you for the values for unset string variables.

Note: The variable block configures a single input variable for a Terraform module. 
      Each block declares a single variable.

How to use above defined variables in terrafrom other files or inside of a same varibles.tf file.

Let me take one more terraform file which is for provide info

vi provider.tf

  provider "aws" {
  access_key = "${var.access_key}"
  secret_key = "${var.secret_key}"
  region     = "${var.region}"
  }
  
  Note: Default variable type in a terraform is string.
  
  Explisity if you want to define then:
        variable "myname" {
          type="string"
         }
  
  
  Now if we run terraform apply command then it will ask for access_key and secret_key and substitues values in provider.tf file.
  
  Terraform accepts variable values in Four ways:
        1. as above
        2. terraform apply -var 'access_key=xxxxxx' -var 'secret_key=xxxxx'
        3. We can create a extra file called terraform.tfvars with varialbe value information as follows
              vi terrafrom.tfvars
                    access_key = "xxxx"
                    secret_key = "xxx"
           Note: if we define variable values in a file some other directory then we can access them with the following syntax
           (Variable Files)
           terraform apply -var-file=foo.tfvars -var-file=bar.tfvars
           Make sure always variable are defined with extention as .tfvars but file name may be any.
           But in current directory if variable file is denined then automatically it can be identified by terraform if file name is
           terrafrom.tfvars
           
        4. From environment variables
              Terraform will read environment variables in the form of TF_VAR_name to find the value for a variable. 
              For example, the TF_VAR_access_key variable can be set to set the access_key variable.
              
              Note: Environment variables can only populate string-type variables. List and map type variables must be populated via one of the 
              other mechanisms.
  
Variable Defaults:
=================
If no value is assigned to a variable via any of these methods and the variable has a default key in its declaration, that value
will be used for the variable.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  
 Let me go indepth:
 The variable block configures a single input variable for a Terraform module.
 Each block declares a single variable.
 
 That is: suppose if we want to define a variable called myname then:
    variable "myname" {}  --> empty variable and it will prompt while running terrarom, default string variable
    variable "myname" {
      type="string"       --> empty variable and it will prompt while running terrarom, explisitly mentioned variable as string.
      }
      
    variable "myname" {
       type="string"
       default="Terraform coaching"
       }
       
    variable "myname" {
       type="string"
       default="Terraform coaching"
       description="This is a info"
     }
     
     type,default and description are optional.
     Make sure that if type is not set then by deault it is a string
                    if default is not set then it will prompt and here if you are not providing then default key value it will take
                    if descripting is not set then it is empty
                    
     Note about descrition:  A human-friendly description for the variable. This is primarily for documentation for users using your 
                            Terraform configuration. When a module is published in Terraform Registry, the given description is shown 
                            as part of the documentation.
                            
                            
                            
    Output variables:
    ---------------
    Try this but not sure as of now:
    
    Outputs are a way to tell Terraform what data is important. This data is outputted when apply is called, and can be queried using 
    the terraform output command.
    
    We can add output variable in any .tf files
        
        output "ip" {
          value = "${var.myname}"
          }
  
  Now run: terraform output
    you will see your output
    #we this output will also displayed while running terraform apply command as well
   
  terrafomr output cmd syntax:
  ===========================
  terraform output
  It will display all outputs
  
  terraform output <out_put_variable>
  It will display only required output variable.
  
  
  #you can also qurey about your variable like: terraform output ip
  
  Note: See more about: terraform output -json instance_ips | jq '.value[0]'
