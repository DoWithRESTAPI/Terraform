Step1: Make directory for any IAC. (and maintaied this by git its better for future purpose)
      ex: mkdir projects_with_tf
Step2: move into projects_with_tf directory
Step3: write a file with .tf or .tf.json extention
      ex: main.tf
      
      content of main.tf (assume cloud provider is aws and you can write for any provide)
      ------------------
      provider "aws" {
        access_key = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
        secret_key = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
        region     = "us-east-1"
     }
     
     #Note: we can also configure credentials with aws configure command on our host
     
     resource "aws_instance" "web" {
        ami           = "ami-234i4323"
        instance_type = "t2.micro"

        tags {
          Name = "HelloWorld"
        }
    }
    
    
Step4: Make sure that there should be no other files other than terrafrom files, because all files in the current directory
       will be read by terrafrom
Step5: Now run:
          terrafrom init  
          Which will download the required plugin for aws cloud. if provider is other than aws then it will download the plugin for that
          provider.
          And creates a .terrafrom and under this plugins stored
Step6: Now run:
          terrafrom plan
          It will show the what infrastructure will create before actually executing it.
          This step is optional. Just to see the details of Infrastructure before creating it.
          
Step7: Now run:
          terrafrom apply
          
          Which will create a infrastructure.
          And also create a files called terraform.tfstate and terraform.tf.backup
Step8: Now run:
          terraform show
           or
          more terrafrom.tfstate
          
          shows the detail info about created infrastructure
Step9: Now run
          terraform destory
          If you want to destroy/delete the created infrastructure.
Step10: terraform refresh  (To refresh the terrafrom state if you did any modification from aws console)
