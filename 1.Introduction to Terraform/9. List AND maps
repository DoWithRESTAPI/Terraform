Terraform lists are simliar to python lists.
Terraform maps are simpilar to python dicts


Defining lists:
===============
                 list value is an ordered sequence of strings indexed by integers starting with zero.
    varialbe "mynewlist" {
       type="list" #This is optional if we define default value, but if we want to read from somewhere we need to write type.
       default=["hi","i","am","fine"]
       }

Note: if values are stored with [] then terrafrom can understand that, that is a list variable



Defining maps:
============= Maps are simplilar to python dict.
              That meank key value pair representation
 
 variable "mymap" {
 type="map"  #This is optional if we define default value, but if we want to read from somewhere we need to write type.
 default={
 "key1"="value1"
 "key2"="value2"
 }
