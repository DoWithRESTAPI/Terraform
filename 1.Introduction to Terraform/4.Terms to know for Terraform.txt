Provider:
        the underlying platforms which support Terraform.
        Or simple the cloud provider.
Resources: 
        resource blocks define components of your infrastructure. 
        Let say: ec2, s3, elb etc...
Data sources: data sources allow data to be fetched or computed for use within Terraform configuration, allowing Terraform to build 
        infrastructure based on information from outside of Terraform (or from a separate Terraform configuration file). 
        Providers are responsible for defining and implementing data sources, which present read-only views of pre-existing data or 
        compute new values on the fly.
